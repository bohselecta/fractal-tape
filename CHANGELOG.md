## Version History

- **v0.2.0** - Production-ready with advanced features
- **v0.1.0** - Initial MVP release

## Migration Guide

### From v0.1.0 to v0.2.0

1. **CLI Changes**
   - New query options require updated command syntax
   - Export format includes additional metadata
   - Glyph training requires new command structure

2. **API Changes**
   - Enhanced type definitions for better TypeScript support
   - New utility functions for address math and windowing
   - Bitmap indexing requires separate initialization

3. **Web Demo**
   - Updated HTML structure for new features
   - Enhanced CSS variables for customization
   - New JavaScript APIs for advanced functionality

## Performance Benchmarks

### v0.2.0 Performance Targets
- **Encoding**: 50k tokens in < 250ms
- **Web UI**: < 16ms typing latency, 20k glyphs @ 60fps
- **Database**: 50k+ tokens/s ingestion rate
- **Compression**: 20-40% size reduction with custom glyphs
- **Bitmap Queries**: Multi-token AND across 1k docs < 10ms

### v0.1.0 Baseline
- **Encoding**: 10k tokens in ~500ms
- **Web UI**: ~50ms typing latency, 5k glyphs @ 30fps
- **Database**: 10k tokens/s ingestion rate
- **Compression**: 10-20% size reduction with default glyphs

## Known Issues

### v0.2.0
- Bitmap index building can be memory-intensive for very large datasets
- Point-to-address conversion is approximate (may be enhanced in future versions)
- Some edge cases in span merging with overlapping thresholds

### v0.1.0
- ~~No advanced query options~~ (Fixed in v0.2.0)
- ~~Limited performance with large datasets~~ (Fixed in v0.2.0)
- ~~No bitmap indexing~~ (Added in v0.2.0)

## Roadmap

### v0.3.0 (Planned)
- PWA support for offline web demo
- Enhanced glyph generation algorithms
- Distributed indexing for very large datasets
- Advanced spatial query capabilities

### Future Considerations
- Machine learning-based glyph optimization
- Multi-language support
